# ponkV2

#### This is a remake of one of my old python projects that I originally made back in 2022 in 100% Python that would get the pic of the day from NASA's website and I wanted to make it not just better but also faster. I have been learning/using Golang for a long time so I thought that this would be a good way for me to learn more about GoLang.
