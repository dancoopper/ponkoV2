# ponkV2

#### This is a remake of one of my old python projects that I originally made back in 2022 in 100% Python that would get the pic of the day from NASA's website and I wanted to make it not just better but also faster. I have been learning/using Golang for a long time so I thought that this would be a good way for me to learn more about GoLang.
# Back story
#### At the time I was looking for project ideas and I always liked making things for people so I decided that I would make an app for my friend. Of course, I went with Python because it was what I was most comfortable with (again not the best idea) and it ended up a lot better than I thought, considering that I couldn't find an API for the NASA pic of the day, so I had to web scrape (you can probably see where this is going) so of course it was VERY slow. The file "R.jpg" is the icon for the app, it is one of the main characters from the movie "Ponyo"
