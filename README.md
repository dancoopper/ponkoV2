# ponkopt2

### This is a remake of one of my old python project that I originally made back in 2022 in 100% python that would get the pic of the day from nasa's website and I wanted to make it not just beter but also faster. I have been learning/using golang for a long time and so I thought that this would be a good way for me to learn more about go lang.
# Back story
### At the time I was looking for project ideas and I always liked making things for people so I desided that I would make an app for my friend. Of couse I went with python because it was what I was most comfotable with (again not the best idea) and it ended up a lot better then I thought, consideiring that I couldn't find an API for the nasa pic of the day, so I had to webscrape (you can probibly see where this is going) so of course it was VERY slow.
